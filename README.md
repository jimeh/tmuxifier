Tmuxify your Tmux. Create, edit, manage and load complex Tmux session, window
and pane configurations with ease.

In short, Tmuxifier allows you to easily create, edit, and load "layout"
files, which are simple shell scripts where you use the `tmux` command and
helper commands provided by `tmuxifier` to manage Tmux sessions and windows

### Window Layouts

Window layouts create a new Tmux window, optionally setting the window title
and root path where all shells are cd'd to by default. It allows you to easily
split a window into specifically sized panes and more as you wish.

You can load a window layout directly into your current Tmux session, or into
a session layout to have the window created along with the session.

### Session Layouts

Session layouts create a new Tmux session, optionally setting a session title
and root path where all shells in the session are cd'd to by default. Windows
can be added to the session either by loading existing window layouts, or
defined directly within the session layout file.

## Example

Given we have a window layout file called [example.window.sh][] which
looks like:

[example.window.sh]: https://github.com/jimeh/tmuxifier/blob/master/examples/example.window.sh

```bash
window_root "~/Desktop"
new_window "Example Window"
split_v 20
run_cmd "watch -t date"
split_h 60
select_pane 0
```

You can then load that window layout into a new window in the
current tmux session using:

    tmuxifier load-window example

Which will yield a Tmux window looking like this:

![example](https://github.com/jimeh/tmuxifier/raw/master/examples/example.window-screenshot.png)

## Installation

Clone the repo to your machine:

    git clone https://github.com/jimeh/tmuxifier.git ~/.tmuxifier

Then add `$HOME/.tmuxifier/bin` to your PATH to make the `tmuxifier` executable
available to you:

__In bash & zsh:__

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.tmuxifier/bin:$PATH"
```

__In tcsh:__

```tcsh
set path = ( "~/.tmuxifier/bin" $path )
```

__In fish:__

```bash
set -gx PATH "~/.tmuxifier/bin" $PATH
```

### Custom Installation Path

To install Tmuxifier somewhere else than the suggested `~/.tmuxifier`, simply
clone the repository to your custom location, and ensure the `bin` folder is
added to your PATH making the `tmuxifier` executable available to you.

## Setup

__In bash & zsh:__

And add the following to your `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc` or
equivalent:

```bash
eval "$(tmuxifier init -)"
```

__In tcsh:__

Add the following to your `~/.cshrc`, `~/.tcshrc` or equivalent:

```tcsh
eval `tmuxifier init -`
```

__In fish:__

And add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` or equivalent:

```bash
eval (tmuxifier init - fish)
```

### Custom Tmux Arguments

If you need to pass custom arguments to `tmux` itself, you can do so by
setting the `TMUXIFIER_TMUX_OPTS` environment variable. For example to set
custom arguments globally:

```bash
export TMUXIFIER_TMUX_OPTS="-L my-awesome-socket-name"
eval "$(tmuxifier init -)"
```

And/or specify dynamically when calling `tmuxifier`:

```bash
TMUXIFIER_TMUX_OPTS="-L other-socket" tmuxifier load-session welcome
```

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/.tmuxifier # or where you've cloned tmuxifier to
git pull
```

## Usage

*__Note:__ This section needs expanding upon.*

For a quick reference on available commands and their aliases, please run:

    tmuxifier help

Tmuxifier doesn't come with any layouts, so you'll want to create your own
window and session layout files. New layout files are populated with examples
and comments explaining what things do. Also, having a look at the
[examples][] directory will also give you a good idea.

### Window Layouts

First off you'll want to define a window layout:

    tmuxifier new-window my-awesome-window

This will create a new layout file called `my-awesome-window.window.sh` in
your `$TMUXIFIER_LAYOUT_PATH`, and open it with the editor defined in
`$EDITOR`. Customize it as you wish, and save.

You can now load *my-awesome-window* with the following command:

    tmuxifier load-window my-awesome-window

You should now have a new Tmux window open created from your custom and
awesome window layout.

### Session Layouts

To create your first session layout, run:

    tmuxifier new-session my-awesome-session

Same deal as with creating a new window, except the filename ends with
`.session.sh` instead of `.window.sh`, and the file's pre-populated content
looks different. To have your awesome window loaded, add `load_window
"my-awesome-window"` to the session layout next to existing examples.

To load the session layout simply run:

    tmuxifier load-session my-awesome-session

You'll now have a new Tmux session with your previously defined awesome window
in it.

## Configure & Customize

### Custom Layouts Path

You can customize the layouts directory used by Tmuxifier by setting
`$TMUXIFIER_LAYOUT_PATH`.

```bash
export TMUXIFIER_LAYOUT_PATH="$HOME/.tmux-layouts"
```

### Disable Shell-Completion

Tmuxifier comes with shell-completion for bash, zsh, tcsh, and fish. If for
any reason you need to disable it, just set `$TMUXIFIER_NO_COMPLETE`.

```bash
export TMUXIFIER_NO_COMPLETE=1
```

## Tips

### iTerm2 Integration

Tmuxifier supports iTerm2's [Tmux integration][]. It can be used in two ways:

- Passing `-CC` as a second argument to the `load-session` command. For
example:

        tmuxifier load-session my-awesome-session -CC

- Setting the `TMUXIFIER_TMUX_ITERM_ATTACH` environment variable to `-CC`
  before calling the `load-session` command.

## Inspiration

- Tmuxifier is largely inspired by [Tmuxinator][].
- The shell script structure and shell-completion setup is heavily
  inspired/ripped from the internals of [rbenv][].

## Tmuxifier vs. Tmuxinator

Though Tmuxifier is largely inspired by the excellent [Tmuxinator][] project,
it does set itself apart in a number of ways:

- Uses shell scripts to define Tmux sessions and windows instead of YAML
  files. The benefit is total control over Tmux, but the definition files are
  more complicated to work with.
- Instead of using a "project" concept, Tmuxifier uses a concept of "sessions"
  and "windows" just like Tmux itself. This allows you to load a whole session
  with multiple pre-defined window configurations, or just load a single
  window configuration into your existing session.
- Tmuxifier is a set of shell scripts, meaning it doesn't require Ruby to be
  installed on the machine.
